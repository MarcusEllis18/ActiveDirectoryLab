<h1>Help Desk Emulation Project (Active Directory + ServiceNow)</h1>

This project documents the process of provisioning a virtual machine in AWS, which serves as the foundation for setting up Active Directory. The VM is configured to support core IT workflows, including:

- User account management

- Password resets

- Incident tracking and resolution

Additionally, this lab includes a hands-on ServiceNow environment, where I explore the platformâ€™s features for IT Service Management (ITSM). This includes creating and managing incident tickets, tracking their lifecycle, and integrating workflows to simulate real-world support operations.
