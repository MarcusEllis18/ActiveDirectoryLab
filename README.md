<h1>Help Desk Emulation Project (Active Directory + ServiceNow)</h1>

This project documents the process of provisioning a virtual machine in AWS, which serves as the foundation for setting up Active Directory. The VM is configured to support core IT workflows, including User account management, password resets as well as incident tracking and resolution. Additionally, this lab includes a hands-on ServiceNow environment, where I create a ticket in ServiceNow.
